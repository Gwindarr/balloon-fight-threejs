Balloon Fight 3D - Game Mechanics PRM
Core Game Concept
Balloon Fight 3D is a modernized 3D reimagining of the classic NES game Balloon Fight. Players control characters suspended by balloons in a 3D environment, attempting to pop opponents' balloons while protecting their own.
Current Implementation Status
Physics System

Gravity: Constant downward force (0.015 units per frame)
Balloon Buoyancy: Each balloon provides upward force (0.009 units per frame)
Movement: WASD for directional control aligned with camera
Flapping: Space bar to flap, giving upward momentum boost
Wind: Simple wind system affecting player movement

Player Mechanics

Default Balloon Configuration: Players start with 3 balloons
Flapping: Tap space repeatedly to gain height and momentum
Balloon Popping: Players pop others' balloons by touching them with their feet/legs
Falling: When all balloons are popped, player falls and is eliminated

Environment

Platforms: Multiple platforms at different heights for movement and strategy
Water: Acts as a hazard with different physics properties
World Boundaries: Bounce players back when they reach edges

Collision System

Player-to-Player: Players bounce off each other when colliding
Player-to-Platform: Multiple collision cases (top, bottom, sides)
Balloon Popping: Specific collision detection for feet-to-balloon interaction

Proposed Gameplay Enhancements
Refined Balloon Physics

Fine-tuned Buoyancy: Adjust so 3 balloons provide just slightly more lift than gravity
Balloon Count Physics:

3 balloons: Very slow rise (vulnerable but safe)
2 balloons: Slow descent
1 balloon: Faster descent (vulnerable)
0 balloons: Rapid fall (elimination)


Height-dependent Buoyancy: Reduced lift at higher altitudes

Strategic Balloon Release

Voluntary Balloon Release: Allow players to strategically release balloons for tactical advantage
Downward Momentum: Releasing a balloon provides downward speed boost
Risk/Reward Balance: Sacrifice safety (fewer balloons) for offensive capability

Advanced Movement Techniques

Platform Jumps: Use platforms to gain height advantage
Momentum Conservation: Allow skilled players to build and maintain momentum
Dive Attacks: Release balloon to dive toward opponents below

Environmental Hazards

Wind Gusts: Periodically changing wind direction and strength
Updrafts: Areas that provide temporary vertical lift

Technical Implementation Notes

const GRAVITY = 0.015;
const BALLOON_BUOYANCY = 0.0052;  // Adjusted so 3 balloons = 0.0156 (slightly > gravity)

Collision Detection System

Box3 collision detection for platform interactions
Sphere-based collision for player-to-player interactions
Specialized detection for feet-to-balloon popping mechanics

Player Animation

Arm animations during flapping
Visual feedback during invincibility periods
Balloon bobbing and swaying animations

Future Development Directions
Multiplayer Implementation

Current system designed with multiplayer in mind
All player entities use uniform structure regardless of local/AI control
Ready for network synchronization in future development

Gameplay Variants

Last Player Standing: Traditional elimination mode
Balloon Collection: Collect balloons scattered around the level
Team Modes: Team-based gameplay with shared objectives

Advanced AI Behaviors

More intelligent platform navigation
Adaptive difficulty based on player skill
Group tactics for multi-opponent scenarios
