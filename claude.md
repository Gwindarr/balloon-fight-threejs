# GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT
## Project Title: Balloon Fight 3D
**Genre:** Action/Arcade Remake
**Platform:** Web (Three.js)
**Target Audience:** Fans of retro games, casual gamers, ages 8+

## 1. High Concept
Balloon Fight 3D is a modern reimagining of the classic NES game Balloon Fight in 3D, where players control a character suspended by balloons. The goal is to navigate through environments, pop opponents' balloons while protecting your own, and stay airborne as long as possible. The 3D environment adds depth to the classic gameplay while maintaining the core mechanics that made the original game enjoyable.

## 2. Core Visual Elements

### Characters
- **Player Character:** A humanoid figure with cylindrical body, spherical head, and attached balloons
- **NPC Opponents:** Similar design to the player, but with different colors to distinguish them
- **Each character has:**
  - 1-3 Balloons (player starts with 3)
  - Distinctive body color (red for player by default)
  - Skin-colored head
  - Animated arms for flapping
  - Legs for visual completeness

### Environment
- **Platforms:** Flat rectangular surfaces where characters can land and launch from
- **Ground:** Base level surface
- **Water:** Optional hazard area
- **Portals:** Transport characters between areas
- **Skybox:** Simple atmospheric background

### Visual Effects
- **Balloon Pop:** Small particle burst when a balloon is popped
- **Shadow:** Dynamic shadow beneath characters that adjusts based on height
- **Player flashing:** Brief invincibility period after losing a balloon

## 3. Core Mechanics

### Movement and Physics
- **Balloon Buoyancy:** Each balloon provides upward force countering gravity
- **Flapping:** Players can "flap" to gain altitude and momentum (Space key)
- **Directional Control:** WASD keys for movement in 3D space
- **Gravity:** Constant downward force
- **Air Resistance:** Gradual slowing of movement
- **Platform Collision:** Characters can land on and launch from platforms

### Balloon Mechanics
- **Balloon Management:**
  - Each balloon provides buoyancy
  - Fewer balloons mean less lift and more vulnerability
  - No balloons means falling and eventual loss
- **Popping Mechanics:**
  - Players pop opponents' balloons by landing on them from above
  - Popped balloons trigger visual effects and sound
  - Characters get brief invincibility after losing a balloon
- **Balloon Types:**
  - Standard character balloons (attached)
  - Released balloons (float away)
  - Detached balloons (physics-driven)

### Camera System
- **Third-person following camera**
- **Camera rotation with mouse**
- **Option for camera distance adjustment**

## 4. Game Flow

### Start
- Player spawns on a platform with 3 balloons
- NPCs spawn on other platforms with 1-3 balloons each

### Gameplay Loop
1. Player navigates the 3D environment using flapping and directional controls
2. Player attempts to pop opponents' balloons by landing on them from above
3. Opponents move around platforms and try to pop player's balloons
4. Player must avoid losing all balloons
5. Portals allow travel between different areas
6. New opponents spawn to replace fallen ones

### Win/Lose Conditions
- **Lose:** Player loses all balloons and falls
- **Win:** In single-player mode, reach a target score or survive for a set time
- **Multiplayer:** Last player with balloons remaining wins

## 5. Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Character System:**
   - Base Character class with shared properties and methods
   - Player class extending Character with input handling
   - NPC class extending Character with AI behavior

2. **Physics System:**
   - Gravity and buoyancy calculations
   - Collision detection (platforms, characters, world boundaries)
   - Balloon physics

3. **Game State Management:**
   - Central state repository to avoid circular dependencies
   - Track player status, NPCs, environment objects
   - Handle game events (balloon pops, character falls, etc.)

4. **Input Handling:**
   - Keyboard controls (WASD, Space)
   - Mouse for camera control
   - Pointer lock for seamless mouse movement

5. **Scene Management:**
   - Environment setup and rendering
   - Camera controls
   - Lighting and effects
